    <p id="act2"><b>Interviewee:</b> Can I tell you my top three first?<br>
    <b>Me:</b> Yes, I would love to hear.<br>
    <b>Interviewee:</b> I love the Automat by Edward Hopper, Grande Odalisque by Jean Auguste Dominique Ingres and The Star by Edgar Degas. But my favorite one is The Star. [Smile]<br>
    <b>Me:</b> Among the paintings I’ve showed you, there are some abstract and also some realistic portraits. Which one is more compelling to you and why? Which portrait and what structure of the painting made you most comfortable to watch?<br>
    <b>Interviewee:</b> So, I think I picked this painting is because it is exactly like what you said. I feel like this is a mix of something realistic, but also has a lot of surrealism especially with the brushstrokes. So if you zoom in, I can see the lovely mix of being messy strokes, but in the same time there is like detailed focus as well. I think it is a great contrast to have both. So why it stood out? Because it was both but in the same time none and I thought that was interesting to have both abstract and realistic feelings.<br>
    <b>Me:</b> What different emotions do you get when the portrait is looking at you and facing away from you?<br>
    <b>Interviewee:</b> [Humm…] That’s a good question. Actually this is why I was very drawn into this [pointing at the Grande Odalisque] at first. Just like what you said that she is looking at me, but in the same time she looks very realistic and I love the lighting of this painting. But I feel like the reason why I picked The Star as my number one was because she was caught in the middle of the time. She is not exactly looking at you, so you are not just focusing on her face but more of the overall painting itself and what’s happening in the painting such as the background, her action, what story it is telling. It is not as compelling as when the portrait is strait at your face. But The Star seems like it has more story and it makes you to focus on all the details.<br>
    <b>Me:</b> Ok, very interesting. Which side of you would you like to emphasize in your portrait? It could be your characteristic, appearance, or anything.<br>
    <b>Interviewee:</b> That’s a very hard question. Maybe something that feels warm? At least when you look at the finished portrait, you have a feeling of “oh she is warm”. I don’t want people to think of me as freaky or dramatic.<br>
    <b>Me:</b> So, your warm heart. Are you familiar with any of these paintings? Where have you seen them before?<br>
    <b>Interviewee:</b> I’m not really familiar with any of these paintings.<br>
    <b>Me:</b> You haven’t seen them before at all?<br>
    <b>Interviewee:</b> No. Are they super famous?<br>
    <b>Me:</b> Some of them are pretty famous I think, but it’s fine. [laughs] Were there any paintings that remind you of an even from your own past? By looking at the paintings, did you feel similar emotions as the figure represented in the paintings?<br>
    <b>Interviewee:</b> I love that question. [smile] That is actually really nice question. Yes, I did but it is not from the past. It is actually now. So, I love how messy and disarray the painting is but it still gives you a beautiful atmosphere. It is a beautiful mess. It made me feel like, my life right now is disarray and I’m not exactly sure. So, things in the background are blurry just like my life. But I  still think my life is beautiful that I am happy and thankful for things that are happening to me right now. I love the ballerina in the painting because the background is hazy but herself is clear and vivid and she looks hopeful. This portrait just reminds me of my life right now.<br>
    <b>Me:</b> Ok. So, is there a specific age or time in your life that you want to capture/record in the painting? It could be future, present, or past.<br>
    <b>Interviewee:</b> Let’s see. Maybe now? So that in a few months, I’m going to be curious of how you captured everything I’ve said and look at your interpretation of my messy life. [laughs]<br>
    <b>Me:</b> There are all classical portraits. Do you want to keep the antique atmosphere, change it to a contemporary feeling or a mixed atmosphere?<br>
    <b>Interviewee:</b> Keep it as classic because I really love the atmosphere that classical paintings give. I think it makes me feel relaxed and calm.<br>
    <b>Me:</b> Not every portraits, but most of figure from the paintings are holding objects in their hand and why do you think they are doing this?<br>
    <b>Interviewee:</b> I think they are doing this on purpose. I think the object tells a story of who the person is in the painting. Maybe she [pointing at the Portrait of Estelle Musson Degas] is a florist and she [pointing at Grande Odalisque] might be a upper class lady because she is holding like a peacock fan. It helps viewer to figure out who the figure is in the painting. It brings a story to life.<br>
    <b>Me:</b> Last question. If you have to display your finished replicated portrait in somewhere, where would you like to display it? Would you like the painting to be shown to public or kept private?<br>
    <b>Interviewee:</b> My instagram. [laughs] I will probably post it and tag you and I also want to keep it in my room. But I also think it is a cool task to open it to public and see how people interpret my portrait.<br> </P>
