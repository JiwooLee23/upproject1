1.Each group members choose a different colored-pen (blue, green, red) and draw an arrow with each of their chosen colors.<br>
2.Draw the next arrows in clockwise turn and arrows can only be drawn from the corner of the previous arrows. Also, the arrow should bent at once.<br>
3.Only red color arrow can intersect or go across the other color arrows.<br>
4.When red goes across or intersects with other colored arrows, red should draw dots around the intersecting point.<br>
5.When there is not other directions to go, stop.</p>

<h3 id="inthe3">Difficulty...</h3>
<p id="difficulty">
Because my group only decided to draw arrows from the previous last arrows in clockwise order,
we got confused when the arrows starts to get complicated.
To solve this problem, we made a rule which is to just draw arrows from a setted color.
Also when the page gets full and red intersects other arrows, drawing dots were a little bit complicated.
